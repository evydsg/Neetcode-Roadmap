            Understand:
                - The idea is to find two numbers that can add up together to the target

                Questions:
                    - Are we always guaranteed to have an answer?
                    - Are we always guaranteed to positive integers?
                    - Can we have an empty list?
            
            Match:
                - Dictionary that keeps track of the current number and difference between him
            
            Plan:
                - Initialize a dictionary
                - Traverse through the list calculating the difference and the target
                - Check if the difference exists in the dictionary

            Evaluate:
                - Time Complexity: O(n), since we traverse through the array
                - Space Complexity: O(n), due to the dictionary
