# Valid Anagram

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
true
```

## Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "jar", t = "jam"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
false
