# Products of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` where `output[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Each product is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Follow-up:
Could you solve it in **O(n)** time without using the division operation?

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [1,2,4,6]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[48,24,12,8]
```

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[0,-6,0,0,0]
